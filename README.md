# ASCII Art Generator

This is a Python script that generates ASCII art based on the word you type.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

### Prerequisites

This script requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

- `pyfiglet`: Used for generating ASCII art from text. You can install it using the following command:

  ```
  pip install pyfiglet
  ```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NicholasStambaugh/ascii-art-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd ascii-art-generator
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Enter the word you want to generate ASCII art for.

5. The script will generate and display the ASCII art in the console.

## File Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.
- `main.py`: This is the main Python script that prompts the user for input and generates the ASCII art.
- `ascii_art.py`: This file contains the implementation of the ASCII art generation logic.

## Acknowledgments

- The ASCII art generation logic is based on the `pyfiglet` library.
